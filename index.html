						<h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Not all  enrolments start their course ...</p>
						<p>Around 17.82% of all students cancel before their first day.</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>END GOALS:</h2>
						<h4>1. Know them</h4>
						<p>> To accurately predict whether a student will cancel from their course.</p>
						<p>Knowing whether a student is likely to cancel can help identify how many students will end up starting a course, helping us predict income and spend outgoings more accurately.</p>
						<h4>2. Stop them</h4>
						<p>>To explore any actionable insights in preventing cancellations.</p>
						<p>Of course, ideally we could stop cancellations from happening and all students who are enrolled will start their course. Perhaps a more realistic objective is to work towards preventing these students from enrolling in the first place.</p>

						<h3>EXPORTING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>Thankfully we have all our data in accessible tables through Looker, so exporting the data wasn't a massive task...</p>
						<p>Just downloading a CSV with 50,000 rows from Looker.</p>
						<div class="coding">enrolments = pd.read_csv("data/courses snap_sales_funnel 2017-07-05T1254.csv", low_memory=False)</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>EXTRAPOLATING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>I added a target column - "Cancelled" based on other columns, as well as an "APAC" column for regional explorations.</p>
						<div class="coding">enrolments['Cancelled'] = enrolments.CanceledDate.notnull()<br>
							enrolments['APAC'] = enrolments['Metro'].isin(['sydney','melbourne','hong-kong','singapore','brisbane'])</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>COMPLETING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>Most of the more recent data was fully complete, but some of the older rows had missing values.</p>
						<p>I cleaned a lot of these by limiting the data to post mid-2014 and pre mid-2017.</p>
						<div class="coding">enrolments = enrolments[enrolments.EnrolDate > 20140630]<br>
							enrolments = enrolments[enrolments.EnrolDate < 20170630]</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>STREAMLINING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>Some of the data categories - Pardot Category, Application Type and Expected Payment Method - had ad hoc entries as well as clear categories, so I limited these to categories with over 100 entries:</p>
						<p>I cleaned a lot of these by limiting the data to post mid-2014 and pre mid-2017.</p>
						<div class="coding">commonapptypes = enrolments.ApplicationType.value_counts().index[enrolments.ApplicationType.value_counts()>100]<br>
							enrolments = enrolments[enrolments.ApplicationType.isin(commonapptypes)]</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>VISUALISING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>I did a bit of exploratory data and distilled some interesting insights into our enrolment data:</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Cancellations by month</h4>
						<p>Although enrolment numbers are down, cancellations are steady:</p>
						<img src="assets/img/cancellations-by-month.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Cancellations by metro</h4>
						<p>Sydney actually has a lower rate of cancellations than other metros:</p>
						<img src="assets/img/cancellations-by-metro.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Payment methods</h4>
						<p>Students who are paying by private loan or on their own pocket are more likely to cancel than employer-paid:</p>
						<img src="assets/img/cancellations-by-pay-method.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Days from Enrolment to Startdate</h4>
						<p>Students enrol close to the start date of their course: </p>
						<img src="assets/img/daysenroltostart-hist.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>DUMMYING THE DATA</h3>
						<p>Some algorithms will only accept numerical or boolean inputs, so the categorical data had to be 'dummied up'. </p>
						<p>This obviously created a lot more columns - I ended up with 103 columns and 39,524 rows.</p>
						<div class="coding">dummydata = pd.get_dummies(data=enrolments, columns = ['Metro','Course','Type','ExpectedPayment','ApplicationType','PardotCategory','EnrolDay'], prefix = ['Metro','Course','Type','ExpectedPayment','ApplicationType','PardotCategory','EnrolDay'] )<br>dummydata.shape<br>>(39524, 103)</div>
